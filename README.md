# Word embedding playground
Code created during KB Research in Residence project "Why girls smile and boys don't cry.". This repository provides tools for training and fine-tuning word embeddings (Word2Vec and FastText) on a selected subset of Dutch Newspapers available in Delpher. It also provides tools for exploring diachronic embeddings along the dimension of political leaning and place.


```python
print("hello world.")
```
