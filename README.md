Holiday.

## Updates 09 - 08

Theory: 
     - Stanford [CS224N  Lecture 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-CspeZ8FHc&feature=youtu.be) â€“ Contextual Word Embeddings
    - Blog post explaining the [BERT Model](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/)
    
Focussed on interactive lexicon expansion, i.e. generating a lexicon based on only a minimal number of seed words. Implemented two approaches:

- [SemAxis](https://github.com/kasparvonbeelen/KB-RiR/blob/master/Notebooks/LexiconExpansion/Interactive-Lexicon-Expansion-SemAxis.ipynb), generates a male-female dimension based on user input. Resulted in a list of 636 "female" words, which can be found [here](https://github.com/kasparvonbeelen/KB-RiR/blob/master/Notebooks/LexiconExpansion/result/female_lexicon.txt). 

	- To do: ensure maximum recall (i.e. are we not missing relevant axis); avoid being stuck in one latent dimension (i.e. female names)
				
- [Active Learning](https://github.com/kasparvonbeelen/KB-RiR/blob/master/Notebooks/LexiconExpansion/Interactive-Lexicon-Expansion-ActiveLearning.ipynb): Uses an active learning pipeline to train a Linear Support Vector Machines that trains a model to classify words as "male" or "female". The confidence for each word is taken as the "gender score"

	- To do: works less than SemAxis. Create at test set to evaluate performance, and determine the optimal hyperparameters of the model.
	
- What happens if we subtract the vector of "children" from the "women". We end up here:
`[('meesteres', 0.5029301047325134),`
 `('doorl', 0.4935253858566284),`
 `('buurvrouw', 0.49145278334617615),`
 `('stiefmoeder', 0.4887046813964844),`
 `('betoovering', 0.48440021276474),`
 `('vasallen', 0.47766774892807007),`
 `('maitresse', 0.47253796458244324),`
 `('stoute', 0.47128427028656006),`
 `('minnares', 0.46352386474609375),`
` ('eminentie', 0.4629545211791992)]`

## Update 16 - 08

Theory:
- Started to compile historical literature on gender stereotypes. See [list](Literatuur.txt)
	
Created list of newspapers to include in dataset. Criteria
- Newspaper runs for more than ten years
- Is a Dutch national or local newspaper (i.e. excluding the Dutch Indies/Indonesia, Suriname etc.)
- Is a newspaper (exluding periodical such as periodicals that serve as organs for specific institutions)
- Title of the newspaper is Dutch
	
Lexicon Expansion:

- Extended the lexicon expansion to make it more interactive. A user select words, and travel the vector space in this dimension. The goals is to generate a comprehensive list of words related to a concept (i.e. "women"). This helped so far to distinguish distinctive categories of women words (family related, professional and artistic nouns)
	
	- Visualized the process and results of the lexicon expansion.
	
		- All women words plotted in a 2-dimensional space. Figure [here](./Notebooks/LexiconExpansion/fig/women_words_2d.png).
		
		- Change of the "women"-axis after 10 iterations of annotation. Figure [here](./Notebooks/LexiconExpansion/fig/semaxis_movemnt.png).
		
		- Women words in a 3-dimensional space after 10 iterations. Figure [here](./Notebooks/LexiconExpansion/fig/women_words_3d_iteration10.png).
		
	- Code and results can be found in [this Notebook](./Notebooks/LexiconExpansion/Interactive-Lexicon-Expansion-SemAxis-Vis.ipynb)
